## Why we use Golang-Migrate package

We use Golang-Migrate in this project to manage our database schema changes. With Golang-Migrate, we can easily create and manage database migrations in a database-agnostic way, allowing us to switch between different database backends without having to modify our migration code.

In addition, Golang-Migrate provides rollback functionality, which allows us to easily revert to a previous version of the database schema if needed, and transaction support, which ensures that all migrations are executed atomically, preventing data inconsistencies during the migration process.
