# GORM Package

The GORM package is a popular ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library for Go. It simplifies database interactions by providing a high-level interface to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on database records.

## Installation

To install the GORM package, use the following command:

```bash
go get -u gorm.io/gorm
```

### Usage

To use the GORM package in your Go project, import it as follows:

go
Copy code

```go
import "gorm.io/gorm"
```

### Features

The GORM package offers the following features:

* Easy configuration and setup with various supported databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, SQL Server, and more)
* Model definition and mapping to database tables
* Automatic table creation and migration based on model changes
* Support for CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
* Query building using a fluent interface or raw SQL
* Advanced querying with conditions, sorting, pagination, and joins
* Transaction management
* Association handling (One-to-One, One-to-Many, Many-to-Many)
* Hooks for executing actions before or after certain database operations
* Integration with third-party libraries, such as database connection pools and logging frameworks

## Why we use GORM package

We use GORM in this project for database operations and ORM functionality. GORM provides an easy-to-use and powerful API for working with databases in Go. It abstracts away the complexities of writing raw SQL queries and simplifies common database tasks like querying, inserting, updating, and deleting records. With GORM, we can define our models and their relationships, and GORM handles the underlying SQL operations transparently. This makes it easier for us to develop and maintain our application's database layer, as well as leverage advanced querying and association capabilities. GORM's flexibility and compatibility with multiple database systems also make it a suitable choice for projects that require support for different database backends.
